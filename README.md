## About The Project


## Usage
This example works on the STM32F429 DISC0 board. But should be portable to any other mcu.  
* First build the userlib.a. This is a static library aka archive. The app will be linked to this archive.  
``mkdir -p build/userlib``  
``cd build/userlib``  
``cmake ../.. -DTARGET_GROUP=userlib -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../../cross.cmake``  
``make``  
A folder called **lib** will be created. This folder will contain everything required to build the app.  
It contains the header files and the userlib.a archive.   
Copy this folder to the apps folder.  
``cp -R lib ../../apps/``  

* Now build the app. A example app called blinky is provided.  
This app turn on LED1. There is some extra code in the example to purposely populate the data and bss sections  
And also to verify if the GOT is copied properly. ie global variable access.  
``cd apps``  
``mkdir build/``  
``cd build``  
``cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../../cross.cmake``  
``make``  
This should have created **blinky.elf** file. This file now needs to be converted into TINF.

* Create TINF of the app
``python3 ../../elf2tinf/elf2tinf.py --major 1 --minor 0 blinky.elf blinky``  
This should generate 2 files, the **blinky.tinf** and **blinky_tinf.h**   
**blink.tinf** is in a binary format which can be loaded over uart, ble, usb, etc.  
**blinky_tinf.h** is the same binary data in the form of a header file, so I can test it easily, 
without implementing the actual transfer of the binary to the mcu.  
More details about this tool is in the README.md in folder elf2tinf  

* Build the kernel
``mkdir -p build/debug``  
``cd build/debug``  
Build the kernel, this is the code that will actually load the app and run it  
``cmake ../.. -DTARGET_GROUP=kernel -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../../cross.cmake``  
``make``  
This will generate the **main.elf** file which needs to be loaded onto the board.

* Load main.elf
This can vary depending on your method.  
If you use gdb then simply, with something like openocd already running in the background then simply  
``make flash``
